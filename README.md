# speedLogger
A simple Bash script that logs download and upload speeds to a file, allowing you to keep track of your internet's performance over time. **Requires the Python-based [speedtest-cli](https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli) to be installed.**

By default, `speedLogger.log` will be created in the same directory. The name and path of this log may be changed through the `LOG` variable at the top of the script.
